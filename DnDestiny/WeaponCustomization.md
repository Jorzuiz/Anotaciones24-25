### Tier 1

`Precision Frame` The range band of this weapon
is increased, the extended and maximum ranges of
this weapon increase by 10 feet each, and the
damage die size of this weapon increases by one
when you take a shot with it while Aiming. Finally, if
this weapon has the High Recoil property, this
weapon loses the High Recoil property and gains the
Finesse property instead.

`Rifled Barrel` This weapon gains a bonus +2 to its
damage rolls when you take a shot with it.

`Shot Package` All ranges of this weapon increase
by 5 feet. You gain a bonus +1 to attack and damage
rolls when you take a shot with this weapon.

### Tier 2

`Armor-Piercing Rounds` The rounds fired from
this weapon can pierce most barriers, but are
blocked by 1 inch of metal, 2 inches of stone, or 3
feet of wood or dirt. These rounds can also damage
all creatures in a line up to this weaponâ€™s effective
range (while Aiming, up to extended range instead).
In order to do this, your attack must have killed the
previous target, and your attack roll must beat the
AC of the subsequent target. Subsequent targets
take the remaining damage of the previous target.

`Battle Runner` If you kill a hostile creature with a
shot from this weapon, your base walking speed
increases by 10 feet for the next minute. The effect
of this perk is lost early if you switch weapons or
stop holding this weapon. The effect of this perk
cannot stack with itself regardless of the number of
weapons you are holding that have this perk.

`Elemental` This weapon's damage type changes
to one of the following: arc, solar, or void. You
cannot alter this choice once made, and you cannot
remove this perk once it has been applied.

`Exhumed` You can take a shot with this weapon
once on the turn that you are revived from death.
You have advantage on your attack roll for that shot.

`Snapshot` It costs 10 less feet of movement to
begin Aiming with this weapon.

### Tier 3

`Final Round` Your critical hit range is increased
by 1 when you take a shot with this weapon. If you
take a shot with this weapon and score a critical hit,
you can add a bonus damage die to this weapon's
damage roll before accounting for the effects of the
critical hit.

`One-two Punch` If you hit a hostile creature with
a shot from this weapon, the next melee attack you
make before the end of your next turn has its
damage increased by 1d6.

`Surrounded` If you take a shot with this weapon
when two or more hostile creatures are within 15
feet of you, you have advantage on your attack roll
for that shot. You can only benefit from this perk
once on your turn.

`Trench Barrel` If you hit a hostile creature with a
melee attack, until the end of your next turn, this
weapon's gains a bonus +2 to damage rolls.
